# Power BI Reports for Case Management

## Report Overview
Power BI visualizes case management data to track performance and identify trends.

## Key Reports
1. **Case Trends**:
   - Displays the number of cases created, resolved, and pending over time.
   - Helps identify peak periods and workload distribution.

2. **Resolution Time**:
   - Visualizes average and maximum resolution times for cases.
   - Tracks SLA compliance and identifies bottlenecks.

3. **Team Performance**:
   - Shows the number of cases handled by each team member.
   - Highlights top performers and areas needing improvement.

## Steps to Create Reports
1. Connect Power BI to the `CaseManagement` SharePoint list.
2. Load and clean the data in Power Query.
3. Create visuals like line charts, bar charts, and tables.
4. Publish the report to the Power BI service and share it with stakeholders.
